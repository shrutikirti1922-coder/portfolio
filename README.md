2. **profile-photo.png** - Your professional profile picture

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### GitHub Pages Setup

1. **Both files must be in the same folder/directory**
   - Make sure `index.html` and `profile-photo.png` are together
   - Do NOT put them in separate folders

2. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - Go to your repository: https://github.com/shrutikirti1922-coder/portfolio
   - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Drag BOTH files at once
   - Commit changes

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: Select "main" branch
   - Folder: Select "/ (root)"
   - Click Save

4. **Your live URL will be:**
   ```
   https://shrutikirti1922-coder.github.io/portfolio/
   ```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**If profile photo doesn't show:**
- Make sure both files are in the ROOT of your repository (not in a subfolder)
- The files should be at the same level:
  ```
  portfolio/
  ├── index.html
  └── profile-photo.png
  ```
- Wait 1-2 minutes after uploading for GitHub Pages to rebuild

**If you see a 404 error:**
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings → Pages
- Verify the branch is set to "main"
- The deployment takes 1-2 minutes
